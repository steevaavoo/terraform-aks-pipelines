# Goals

1. Get an Azure K8s Cluster set up using Terraform through Azure Pipelines
1. Deploy an App (nginxdemo) through Azure Pipelines

## Method

I'll follow this [tutorial](https://www.azuredevopslabs.com/labs/vstsextend/terraform/)
get familiar with the process, then retrofit it to serve my above purposes.

Notes will be kept in a separate file and will follow my rather random way of thinking, so
please forgive any meandering nonsense...
